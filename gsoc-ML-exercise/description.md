# Read Candels Solution
To solve the problem, I used a simple linear iterpolation. First, iterate over the input values, for a given a galaxy, extract positive fluxes and the corresponding wavelengths. The interpolation is applied for every galaxy to predict the fluxes of the required wavelengths given the fluxes of the input wavelenghts. Then, all the data is stored in a single dictionary that maps the field to a 2D array of galaxies and predicted fluxes. If I had more time, I would train a DL model to perform the task. The DL model can either be a regression model that predicts a numerical flux value of a required wavelength given fluxes of specific wavelengths as input, or the it can be a Density estimation model that builds a probability distribution and sample from it the flux values. 
# Plot
To visualize what I did, I re-used the visualization code of the original notebook and added the predicted fluxes of the required wavelenghts for a random galaxy in the GOODS-S field.
